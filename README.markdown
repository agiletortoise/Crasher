# Crasher

This is a stupid iOS app that does nothing but register a URL scheme and crash if launched via that URL scheme.

Why would you want to do that?  You probably wouldn't, but it is a stupid hack to create a URL scheme that can be used in automation workflows to make you end up on your home screen.

This example uses the "x-crasher://" URL scheme.

Obviously, this is not something that would ever be allowed in the App Store, but if you have a dev account and the desire to have a URL scheme for the home screen â€“ have at it.
