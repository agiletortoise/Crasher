# Crasher

This is a stupid iOS app that does nothing but register a URL scheme and crash if launched via that URL scheme.

Why would you want to do that?  You probably wouldn't, but it is a stupid hack to create a URL scheme that can be used in automation workflows to make you end up on your home screen.

This example uses the "x-crasher://" URL scheme.
